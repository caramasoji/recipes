    <p>If you haven’t heard of <strong>Marry Me Chicken</strong>, it’s time you open your heart to it. Readers adore it, so naturally I had to adapt the skillet version into an irresistible pasta! This dish has a similar simple creamy garlic, parmesan, tomato sauce with a perfect union of herbs.</p>
    <p>Using rotisserie or leftover chicken is one of my favorite shortcuts, and it works great in this marry me pasta. The marriage of flavors in the creamy sauce will supposedly snag you a spouse. It’ll be love at first bite with this 30-minute pasta that’s super easy to make.</p>
   
    <h2>What you’ll need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta</strong> – use any shape! I like a sturdy pasta that holds sauce well like rigatoni or farfalle.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter and flour</strong> – to make a quick roux to thicken it up</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> – for savory goodness</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato paste and sun-dried tomatoes</strong> – plenty of concentrated tomato flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Wine</strong> – use a dry white wine like sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio, or use chicken broth</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong> – using real cream makes sauces as silky as satin</li>
        <li><strong>Oregano and fresh basil</strong> – this duo gives a herby burst of flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Red pepper flakes</strong> – they give a gentle warmth/depth of flavor and don’t make it spicy. I wouldn’t skip them! They really enhance the taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong> – I use rotisserie for ease</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan</strong> – freshly grated tastes and melts into the sauce better</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pro tip</h2>
    <p>To make this recipe really pop, choose a white wine you actually enjoy drinking. I don’t ever recommend cooking wine. It’s lower quality than the kind you drink and can be extremely salty, therefore not suitable for being consumed on its own, so I don’t like to cook with it either.</p>
     
    <h2>How to make marry me chicken pasta</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a skillet. Stir in the flour until combined, cooking for about a minute. Add the garlic, tomato paste, and white wine. Let it bubble. Add the cream, sun-dried tomatoes, oregano, crushed red pepper, and chicken.</li>
        <li>Stir the sauce, and cook until it’s reduced somewhat. Add in the parmesan and basil, and remove from the stove. Generously season with salt & pepper to bring out the flavors. Toss with the drained pasta, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Substitutions and variations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You could try adding in some spinach towards the end of cooking time to add some greens!</li>
        <li>I don’t recommend subbing the cream for something lower fat because there’s a good chance the sauce will curdle due to the acidity from the tomatoes, and the sauce won’t thicken as well.</li>
        <li>You can leave out the chicken if you want it to be a meatless meal, or use shrimp instead of chicken for a twist.</li>

        <li>A Microplane grater is the best way to get a nice dusting of parmesan.</li>
